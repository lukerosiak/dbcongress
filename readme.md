DBCONGRESS

A django app to parse XML, JSON and YAML files generated by these projects:

https://github.com/unitedstates/congress

https://github.com/unitedstates/congress-legislators

and put them into a relational database of your choice.

By Luke Rosiak. A work in progress. Released under whatever terms you want.
