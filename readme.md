DBCONGRESS

A django app to parse XML, JSON and YAML files generated by these projects:

https://github.com/unitedstates/congress

https://github.com/unitedstates/congress-legislators

and put them into a relational database of your choice.

By Luke Rosiak. A work in progress. Released under whatever terms you want.

INSTRUCTIONS

If you don't already have them somewhere, in the same directory you install this app:

git clone https://github.com/unitedstates/congress-legislators

git clone https://github.com/unitedstates/congress

create the JSON files in the Congress app by 

cd congress

./run votes
./run bills
./run amendments

Now on to actually using this app:

In local_settings.py, define the necessary variables

In settings.py: from local_settings import *

Then:

python manage.py syncdb

python manage.py parse_legislators

python manage.py parse_committees

python manage.py parse_votes

python manage.py parse_bills

python manage.py parse_amendments

(not all info is extracted from bills because the structure can vary. but improvements are welcome)

A lot of the magic happens in dicttomodel.py, that uses model introspection to intelligently fit JSON into Django model--not very complicated, but using this framework will make expanding and modifying the relational-db representations of the JSON files a lot simpler.
